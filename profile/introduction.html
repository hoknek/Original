            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <h2>My name is Ken Otsuka.</h2> 
            Orignally from Japan, I currently live in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts 
            with my wife Melanie and my dog Iggy. I decided to join this bootcamp because 
            I wanted to get into the technology world. I am facinted by the digital 
            world and how it has been unfolding for the last couple of decades.
            As the technolgy advanced, the speed in which the world has been changing 
            increased exponentially and I saw the value of programming
            grow rapidly. With the onset of COVID, the entire world has been placed 
            upside down and what was already a complex world became more confusing 
            than ever. Where will all this go? Will we take this and create an utopian 
            society? Will AI takeover the world? I don't know. But I knew what I 
            was going to do. I was going to take this opportunity to learn and understand 
            what goes on behind the screens and all the technology that we all 
            use everyday, and join others who control the world through the language of 
            one and zero.
